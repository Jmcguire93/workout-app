Contract (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, be careful to avoid movement in your low back throughout the exercise. 2.) Slowly exhale while pushing the resistance plate away from your body by contracting your glutes, quadiceps and hamstrings. Keep your heels flat against the resistance plate and avoid any movement in the upper extremity. 3.) Continue extending your hips and knees until the knees reach a relaxed, extended position, with the heels still pressed firmly into the plate.  Do not hyperextend (lock-out) your knees and avoid lifting your butt off the seat pad or rounding out your low back. 4.)

  { name: "Lunge", muscle_group: "Legs, Butt and Hips", instructions: "1.) Starting Position: Stand with your feet together. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and brace (engage your abdominal/core muscles) to stiffen your spine. 2.) In preparation to step forward, slowly lift one foot off the floor, stabilizing your body on the stance (supporting) leg. Avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot. Hold this position momentarily before stepping forward. The raised (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the leading (forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you load into this leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot. 3.) As you lunge forward, focus more on dropping your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward. This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your front thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean. While lunging, simultaneously, bend forward at your hips, maintaining a flat back. 4.) Firmly push off with your front leg, activating both your quads and glutes (thighs and butt muscles) to return to your upright, starting position.", image: "https://acewebcontent.azureedge.net/exercise-library/large/94-1.jpg" },

Starting Position: Stand with your feet parallel about hip width apart while holding dumbbells in your hands with palms facing inwards. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back).Attempt to avoid shrugging your shoulder upwards. 2.) Upward Phase: Slowly step to place your right foot on a platform, placing your foot firmly on the deck while keeping your torso upright and aligning your knee over your second toe. Push off with the trailing (left) leg to raise your body onto the platform placing that foot alongside your leading (right) foot. During this transition, your torso and your right tibia (shinbone) will move slightly forward past vertical, but try to avoid excessive forward movement. 3.) Downward Phase: Slowly load the weight of your body into your leading (right) foot, step backwards to place the trailing (left) foot on the floor in its starting position. Allow your body to lean slightly forward during the step-down movement. Load your weight into your trailing (left) foot and step off the platform with your leading (right) foot, returning to your starting position. Repeat for the opposite side. 4.) An exercise progression is to step-up onto one leg only and remain standing on a single-leg before stepping back down. Single-leg stepping is a functional movement we perform daily. Always monitor your foot, ankle and knee position. Avoid movement of your foot and ankle (collapsing in or out), and always attempt to keep your knee aligned over your second toe.", image: "https://acewebcontent.azureedge.net/exercise-library/large/28-2.jpg" },

Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly bend each elbow in unison, bringing the dumbbells towards your chest without arching your back or moving your elbows forward. Maintain a neutral wrist position (avoid flexion and extension of your wrists) and keep contact with your head, shoulder and butt against the bench. Keep your feet firmly placed on the floor and avoid shrugging your shoulders during the lift keeping your scapulae (shoulders) depressed and retracted. 3.) Downward Phase: Inhale and gently lower the dumbbells back towards your starting position. 4.) Variation to this exercise: To emphasize more biceps activity change your starting position. Turn your palms towards your sides and rotate them forward (or up) during the upward phase before your forearms reach horizontal. During the downward phase rotate your forearms back inward as your forearms reach horizontal. Curl the dumbbells higher by allowing the elbows to move forward as the dumbbell reaches your chest, moving the upper arm towards horizontal with the floor. This places a little more emphasis on the biceps and some anterior shoulder muscles.", image: "https://acewebcontent.azureedge.net/exercise-library/large/44-2.jpg" },

Depress and retract your left scapula (pull your shoulder down and back) and maintain this position throughout the exercise. Your head should be aligned with your spine. 2.) Position the your left upper arm parallel to, and close to, your torso. Bend your elbow to 90 degrees or at least to a point where your forearm hangs vertical to the floor. 3.) Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly extend (straighten) your elbow by contracting your triceps muscles until your elbow is fully extended. Your upper arm should remain stationary next to your torso and not raised during the movement. Avoid any arching (sagging) in your low back or any rotation in your torso. 4.) Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly return your arm to your starting position, without changing your torso position. Maintain your upper arm parallel and close to your torso. Proper form in performing this exercise is important to target triceps activity and for safety reasons to prevent additional loading on your spine.", image: "https://acewebcontent.azureedge.net/exercise-library/large/55-1.jpg" },

Exhale and slowly lift the dumbbells to your shoulder level with a closed, pronated grip (palms facing forward and thumbs wrapped around the handles), with the dumbbells at shoulder-width or slightly wider and wrists in a neutral position (avoid flexion and extension of the wrists). Retract and depress your scapulae (pull down and back) and hold this scapulae position throughout the exercise. 2.) Upward Phase: Exhale and press the dumbbells overhead in unison until your elbows are fully extended without any arching in your low back. Maintain your body contact with the bench, neutral wrist (avoid flexion and extension) and depressed, retracted scapulae positions. For more comfort through the range-of-motion keep your elbows pointed in front of you. 3.) Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells in a controlled manner by flexing (bending) your elbows while maintaining a rigid torso, neutral wrists and contact with the bench and floor. Avoid simply yielding to gravity and consciously try to contract your lats and pull the dumbbells down towards you. Spotting is important to ensure safety in this exercise.

Stiffen your torso by contracting your abdominal and core muscles (bracing), and depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back), maintaining this position throughout the exercise. Your head position should be aligned with your spine. 3.) Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly raise the dumbbells up and out to your sides. Your elbows and upper arms should rise together and be slightly ahead of your forearms and dumbbells. As your arms move past 60 - 70 degrees (nearing shoulder level), rotate them slightly upwards so that the front edge of the dumbbells point slightly upwards. Continue raising the dumbbells until your arms are level with your shoulders and approximately parallel with the floor. Maintain your torso erect (no arching your low back) and neutral wrist position (avoid flexion and extension of your wrists). 4.) Downward Phase: Inhale and gently lower the dumbbells back towards your starting position keeping your elbows slightly extended and holding the neutral grip position. Maintain your foot, torso, shoulder and wrist positions while lowering the dumbbells and rotating them slightly downwards as your arms pass that 60-70 degree mark. As this exercise traditionally positions the arms into internal rotation during the lift, the slight external rotation initiated at the 60-70 degree mark may reduce potential impingement in the shoulder joint.", image: "https://acewebcontent.azureedge.net/exercise-library/large/26-1.jpg" },
